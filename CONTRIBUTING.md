# Contributing to Reson

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Reson! This document outlines the process for contributing.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** and clone your fork
2. Set up your development environment (see READMEs in `reson-rust/` and `reson-py/`)
3. Create a feature branch from `main`

## Requirements for Contributions

### Integration Tests Are Mandatory

**No new feature gets merged without integration tests that run against real LLM APIs.**

Unit tests are welcome and appreciated, but they're not sufficient on their own. Every feature must be battle-tested with live API calls before it can be merged. This means:

- If you touch a provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, OpenRouter, Bedrock), you need to run integration tests against that provider's real API
- New features require new integration tests that make actual LLM calls
- Existing integration tests for affected code paths must pass

### Running Integration Tests

```bash
# Set API keys for providers you're testing
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
export GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key

# Python integration tests
cd reson
source .venv/bin/activate
pytest integration_tests/ -v

# Rust tests
cd reson-rust
cargo test --features full
```

### Linting and Formatting Requirements

All code must pass linting and be properly formatted before it can be merged:

```bash
cd reson-rust

# Rust - clippy with warnings as errors
cargo clippy --all-features -- -D warnings

# Rust - format your code
cargo fmt --all

# Rust - verify formatting (CI runs this)
cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

### What We Look For

- Integration tests that exercise the feature with real LLM responses
- Tests covering both success and error paths where applicable
- Clear test names that describe what's being validated

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure all integration tests pass locally with real API calls
2. Add integration tests for any new functionality
3. Update documentation if needed
4. Submit your PR with a clear description of the changes

## A Note on Direction

PRs are welcome and appreciated! That said, if a contribution doesn't align with the project's direction, it doesn't mean the work isn't valued - it's just a matter of fit. Reson has a specific vision (agents as functions, minimal abstractions, native provider APIs), and contributions should move in that direction.

If you're unsure whether something aligns, feel free to open an issue first to discuss.
