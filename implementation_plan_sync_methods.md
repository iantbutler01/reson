# Implementation Plan - COMPLETED ✅

## Overview
Add synchronous database interfaces alongside existing async interfaces in the PostgreSQL models module.

This implementation will provide parallel synchronous methods with a 'sync_' prefix for all existing async database operations in the models.py and manager.py files. This allows users to choose between async and sync interfaces based on their application requirements, maintaining backward compatibility while extending functionality.

## Types
Add synchronous connection and cursor type annotations for psycopg3.

The implementation will introduce synchronous type annotations and connection handling:
- SyncConnection type for psycopg.Connection[DictRow] ✅
- SyncCursor type for psycopg.Cursor[DictRow] ✅
- Synchronous pool type AsyncConnectionPool -> ConnectionPool ✅
- Context variables for synchronous connection reuse ✅

## Files
Modify existing files to add synchronous interfaces.

Detailed breakdown:
- reson/data/postgres/manager.py: Add synchronous connection pool, sync context management, and sync query execution methods ✅
- reson/data/postgres/models.py: Add sync_ prefixed methods for all async database operations ✅

## Functions
Add synchronous versions of all async database functions.

DatabaseManager functions added:
- sync_get_connection(): Synchronous connection context manager ✅
- sync_get_cursor(): Synchronous cursor context manager ✅
- sync_execute_query(): Synchronous query execution ✅
- sync_execute_and_fetch_one(): Synchronous single row fetch ✅
- sync_execute_and_return_id(): Synchronous ID return from INSERT ✅

DBModel functions added:
- sync_get(): Synchronous record retrieval by ID ✅
- sync_get_many(): Synchronous batch retrieval by IDs ✅
- sync_list(): Synchronous list with optional filtering ✅
- sync_find_by(): Synchronous find by column values ✅
- sync_get_with_preload(): Synchronous get with relationship preloading ✅
- sync_list_with_preload(): Synchronous list with relationship preloading ✅
- sync_find_by_with_preload(): Synchronous find with relationship preloading ✅
- sync_update(): Synchronous record update ✅
- sync_delete(): Synchronous record deletion (class method) ✅
- sync_delete_many(): Synchronous batch deletion ✅
- sync_insert_many(): Synchronous batch insertion ✅
- sync_persist(): Synchronous record persistence ✅
- sync_persist_with_id(): Synchronous persistence with explicit ID ✅
- sync_to_json_dict(): Synchronous JSON serialization ✅
- _sync_serialize_value(): Synchronous value serialization helper ✅

JoinTableDBModel functions added:
- sync_get_by_pks(): Synchronous retrieval by composite primary keys ✅
- sync_persist(): Synchronous persistence for join table records ✅
- sync_delete_by_pks(): Synchronous deletion by composite primary keys ✅

## Classes
Modify existing classes to support dual interfaces.

Detailed breakdown:
- DatabaseManager: Add synchronous pool and connection management alongside async ✅
- DBModel: Extend with sync_ methods maintaining same signatures as async versions ✅
- JoinTableDBModel: Extend with sync_ methods for composite key operations ✅
- No new classes needed - extending existing ones ✅

## Dependencies
Add synchronous psycopg3 pool dependency.

Details of package requirements:
- psycopg[pool]: Already installed, includes psycopg_pool.ConnectionPool for sync operations ✅
- No additional packages needed ✅
- Maintain compatibility with existing async psycopg usage ✅

## Testing
Verify synchronous interfaces work correctly.

Test requirements:
- Create integration_tests/test_sync_postgres.py to test synchronous operations ✅
- Test sync CRUD operations on DBModel ✅
- Test sync composite key operations on JoinTableDBModel ✅
- Test sync relationship preloading ✅
- Test sync/async method interoperability ✅
- Verify connection pool management for both sync and async ✅

## Implementation Order - ALL COMPLETED ✅
Logical sequence to minimize conflicts and ensure successful integration.

1. ✅ Update DatabaseManager in manager.py to add synchronous pool and connection management
2. ✅ Add sync_get_connection and sync_get_cursor context managers to DatabaseManager
3. ✅ Add sync query execution methods to DatabaseManager (sync_execute_query, sync_execute_and_fetch_one, sync_execute_and_return_id)
4. ✅ Add sync_get and sync_get_many methods to DBModel
5. ✅ Add sync_list and sync_find_by methods to DBModel
6. ✅ Add sync_update, sync_delete, sync_delete_many methods to DBModel
7. ✅ Add sync_insert_many, sync_persist, sync_persist_with_id methods to DBModel
8. ✅ Add sync preloading methods (sync_get_with_preload, sync_list_with_preload, sync_find_by_with_preload) to DBModel
9. ✅ Add sync_to_json_dict and _sync_serialize_value helper to DBModel
10. ✅ Add sync_get_by_pks, sync_persist, sync_delete_by_pks to JoinTableDBModel
11. ✅ Create test file to verify all synchronous operations
12. ✅ Run tests to ensure both sync and async interfaces work correctly

## Summary

All synchronous database interfaces have been successfully implemented alongside the existing async interfaces. The implementation provides:

- **Complete feature parity**: Every async method now has a synchronous counterpart with `sync_` prefix
- **Backward compatibility**: All existing async code continues to work without modification
- **Connection pooling**: Both sync and async operations use efficient connection pooling
- **Transaction support**: Synchronous transactions with proper commit/rollback handling
- **Relationship preloading**: Synchronous support for efficient JOIN-based relationship loading
- **Comprehensive testing**: All synchronous operations tested and verified to work correctly

Users can now choose between async and sync interfaces based on their application needs while maintaining the same functionality and performance characteristics.
