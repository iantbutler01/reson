Gemini models can process videos, enabling many frontier developer use cases that would have historically required domain specific models. Some of Gemini's vision capabilities include the ability to:

Describe, segment, and extract information from videos
Answer questions about video content
Refer to specific timestamps within a video
Gemini was built to be multimodal from the ground up and we continue to push the frontier of what is possible. This guide shows how to use the Gemini API to generate text responses based on video inputs.

Video input
You can provide videos as input to Gemini in the following ways:

Upload a video file using the File API before making a request to generateContent. Use this method for files larger than 20MB, videos longer than approximately 1 minute, or when you want to reuse the file across multiple requests.
Pass inline video data with the request to generateContent. Use this method for smaller files (<20MB) and shorter durations.
Pass YouTube URLs as part of your generateContent request.
Upload a video file
You can use the Files API to upload a video file. Always use the Files API when the total request size (including the file, text prompt, system instructions, etc.) is larger than 20 MB, the video duration is significant, or if you intend to use the same video in multiple prompts. The File API accepts video file formats directly.

The following code downloads the sample video, uploads it using the File API, waits for it to be processed, and then uses the file reference in a generateContent request.

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST

VIDEO_PATH="path/to/sample.mp4"
MIME_TYPE=$(file -b --mime-type "${VIDEO_PATH}")
NUM_BYTES=$(wc -c < "${VIDEO_PATH}")
DISPLAY_NAME=VIDEO

tmp_header_file=upload-header.tmp

echo "Starting file upload..."
curl "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/upload/v1beta/files" \
  -H "x-goog-api-key: $GEMINI_API_KEY" \
  -D ${tmp_header_file} \
  -H "X-Goog-Upload-Protocol: resumable" \
  -H "X-Goog-Upload-Command: start" \
  -H "X-Goog-Upload-Header-Content-Length: ${NUM_BYTES}" \
  -H "X-Goog-Upload-Header-Content-Type: ${MIME_TYPE}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{'file': {'display_name': '${DISPLAY_NAME}'}}" 2> /dev/null

upload_url=$(grep -i "x-goog-upload-url: " "${tmp_header_file}" | cut -d" " -f2 | tr -d "\r")
rm "${tmp_header_file}"

echo "Uploading video data..."
curl "${upload_url}" \
  -H "Content-Length: ${NUM_BYTES}" \
  -H "X-Goog-Upload-Offset: 0" \
  -H "X-Goog-Upload-Command: upload, finalize" \
  --data-binary "@${VIDEO_PATH}" 2> /dev/null > file_info.json

file_uri=$(jq -r ".file.uri" file_info.json)
echo file_uri=$file_uri

echo "File uploaded successfully. File URI: ${file_uri}"

# --- 3. Generate content using the uploaded video file ---
echo "Generating content from video..."
curl "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash:generateContent" \
    -H "x-goog-api-key: $GEMINI_API_KEY" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -X POST \
    -d '{
      "contents": [{
        "parts":[
          {"file_data":{"mime_type": "'"${MIME_TYPE}"'", "file_uri": "'"${file_uri}"'"}},
          {"text": "Summarize this video. Then create a quiz with an answer key based on the information in this video."}]
        }]
      }' 2> /dev/null > response.json

jq -r ".candidates[].content.parts[].text" response.json
To learn more about working with media files, see Files API.

Pass video data inline
Instead of uploading a video file using the File API, you can pass smaller videos directly in the request to generateContent. This is suitable for shorter videos under 20MB total request size.

Here's an example of providing inline video data:

Python
JavaScript
REST
Note: If you get an Argument list too long error, the base64 encoding of your file might be too long for the curl command line. Use the File API method instead for larger files.

VIDEO_PATH=/path/to/your/video.mp4

if [[ "$(base64 --version 2>&1)" = *"FreeBSD"* ]]; then
  B64FLAGS="--input"
else
  B64FLAGS="-w0"
fi

curl "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash:generateContent" \
    -H "x-goog-api-key: $GEMINI_API_KEY" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -X POST \
    -d '{
      "contents": [{
        "parts":[
            {
              "inline_data": {
                "mime_type":"video/mp4",
                "data": "'$(base64 $B64FLAGS $VIDEO_PATH)'"
              }
            },
            {"text": "Please summarize the video in 3 sentences."}
        ]
      }]
    }' 2> /dev/null
Pass YouTube URLs
Preview: The YouTube URL feature is in preview and is available at no charge. Pricing and rate limits are likely to change.
You can pass YouTube URLs directly to Gemini API as part of your generateContentrequest as follows:

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST

curl "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash:generateContent" \
    -H "x-goog-api-key: $GEMINI_API_KEY" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -X POST \
    -d '{
      "contents": [{
        "parts":[
            {"text": "Please summarize the video in 3 sentences."},
            {
              "file_data": {
                "file_uri": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hE5-98ZeCg"
              }
            }
        ]
      }]
    }' 2> /dev/null
Limitations:

For the free tier, you can't upload more than 8 hours of YouTube video per day.
For the paid tier, there is no limit based on video length.
For models prior to Gemini 2.5, you can upload only 1 video per request. For Gemini 2.5 and later models, you can upload a maximum of 10 videos per request.
You can only upload public videos (not private or unlisted videos).
Refer to timestamps in the content
You can ask questions about specific points in time within the video using timestamps of the form MM:SS.

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST

PROMPT="What are the examples given at 00:05 and 00:10 supposed to show us?"
Extract detailed insights from video
Gemini models offer powerful capabilities for understanding video content by processing information from both the audio and visual streams. This lets you extract a rich set of details, including generating descriptions of what is happening in a video and answering questions about its content. For visual descriptions, the model samples the video at a rate of 1 frame per second. This sampling rate may affect the level of detail in the descriptions, particularly for videos with rapidly changing visuals.

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST

PROMPT="Describe the key events in this video, providing both audio and visual details. Include timestamps for salient moments."
Customize video processing
You can customize video processing in the Gemini API by setting clipping intervals or providing custom frame rate sampling.

Tip: Video clipping and frames per second (FPS) are supported by all models, but the quality is significantly higher from 2.5 series models.
Set clipping intervals
You can clip video by specifying videoMetadata with start and end offsets.

Python
JavaScript

from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client()
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model='models/gemini-2.5-flash',
    contents=types.Content(
        parts=[
            types.Part(
                file_data=types.FileData(file_uri='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEzRZ35urlk'),
                video_metadata=types.VideoMetadata(
                    start_offset='1250s',
                    end_offset='1570s'
                )
            ),
            types.Part(text='Please summarize the video in 3 sentences.')
        ]
    )
)
Set a custom frame rate
You can set custom frame rate sampling by passing an fps argument to videoMetadata.

Note: Due to built-in per image based safety checks, the same video may get blocked at some fps and not at others due to different extracted frames.
Python

from google import genai
from google.genai import types

# Only for videos of size <20Mb
video_file_name = "/path/to/your/video.mp4"
video_bytes = open(video_file_name, 'rb').read()

client = genai.Client()
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model='models/gemini-2.5-flash',
    contents=types.Content(
        parts=[
            types.Part(
                inline_data=types.Blob(
                    data=video_bytes,
                    mime_type='video/mp4'),
                video_metadata=types.VideoMetadata(fps=5)
            ),
            types.Part(text='Please summarize the video in 3 sentences.')
        ]
    )
)
By default 1 frame per second (FPS) is sampled from the video. You might want to set low FPS (< 1) for long videos. This is especially useful for mostly static videos (e.g. lectures). If you want to capture more details in rapidly changing visuals, consider setting a higher FPS value.

Supported video formats
Gemini supports the following video format MIME types:

video/mp4
video/mpeg
video/mov
video/avi
video/x-flv
video/mpg
video/webm
video/wmv
video/3gpp
Technical details about videos
Supported models & context: All Gemini 2.0 and 2.5 models can process video data.
Models with a 2M context window can process videos up to 2 hours long at default media resolution or 6 hours long at low media resolution, while models with a 1M context window can process videos up to 1 hour long at default media resolution or 3 hours long at low media resolution.
File API processing: When using the File API, videos are stored at 1 frame per second (FPS) and audio is processed at 1Kbps (single channel). Timestamps are added every second.
These rates are subject to change in the future for improvements in inference.
You can override the 1 FPS sampling rate by setting a custom frame rate.
Token calculation: Each second of video is tokenized as follows:
Individual frames (sampled at 1 FPS):
If mediaResolution is set to low, frames are tokenized at 66 tokens per frame.
Otherwise, frames are tokenized at 258 tokens per frame.
Audio: 32 tokens per second.
Metadata is also included.
Total: Approximately 300 tokens per second of video at default media resolution, or 100 tokens per second of video at low media resolution.
Medial resolution: Gemini 3 introduces granular control over multimodal vision processing with the media_resolution parameter. The media_resolution parameter determines the maximum number of tokens allocated per input image or video frame. Higher resolutions improve the model's ability to read fine text or identify small details, but increase token usage and latency.

For more details about the parameter and how it can impact token calculations, see the media resolution guide.

Timestamp format: When referring to specific moments in a video within your prompt, use the MM:SS format (e.g., 01:15 for 1 minute and 15 seconds).

Best practices:

Use only one video per prompt request for optimal results.
If combining text and a single video, place the text prompt after the video part in the contents array.
Be aware that fast action sequences might lose detail due to the 1 FPS sampling rate. Consider slowing down such clips if necessary.
What's next
This guide shows how to upload video files and generate text outputs from video inputs. To learn more, see the following resources:

System instructions: System instructions let you steer the behavior of the model based on your specific needs and use cases.
Files API: Learn more about uploading and managing files for use with Gemini.
File prompting strategies: The Gemini API supports prompting with text, image, audio, and video data, also known as multimodal prompting.
Safety guidance: Sometimes generative AI models produce unexpected outputs, such as outputs that are inaccurate, biased, or offensive. Post-processing and human evaluation are essential to limit the risk of harm from such outputs.
